        <p>Californian by birth. Oregonian by upbringing. Pennsylvanian by choice. Lover of Dungeness crab, good food and drink, baseball, and bass guitar.</p>
        <p>Jacob Quinn Sanders has always been in the business of helping tell stories. First that meant reporting and writing. Then editing and strategy, whether user research, workflows, conceiving functionality or strategy -- usually against a tight deadline.</p>

        <p>Now that means coding. Python and Django along with some JavaScript and jQuery, HTML and CSS. They're simply different tools to a similar end. Programming has a lot in common with putting together complex articles and products where accuracy matters. Where readability matters. Where impact and user experience matter.</p>

        <p>With new skills it's time to focus on new projects. On to the next thing.</p>
